        <h2 class="h2">[Professionally]</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a programmer, designer, and QA tester. I have been programming for the last 3 years after 
        buying my first RPi (Raspberry Pi). I went through a programming bootcamp in 2019 to further boost my knowledge. 
        Currently, I work for Onshore Outsourcing based out of Macon, Missouri. I'm currently contracted out
        to Little Caesars Pizza based out of Detroit, Michigan as a Quality Assurance Tester. I'm knowledgable
        in languages - Python, Java, and C#. I have used Tkinter extensivally for python gui's, Android Studio
        for app creations and MVC for Website design (currently the one you're viewing). Through my job, I have
        become efficient in SQL and Azure Dev Ops as well as writing/performing tests. I am also aquainted with
        AWS EC2, ParseServer, json, and several other libraries.

    <h2 class="h2">[Personally]</h2>
    <p>
        I grew up in a rural town in Missouri (Hunstville - Population: 1,600) until joining the US Army in 2006. After serving 2 tours,
        I was honoarbly discharged, and used my GI Bill to get an Associates Degree at Moberly Area Community College.
        Upon graduation, I transferred to Arizona State University and received my Bachelors in English.
        If the weather is nice, and the wind is calm - I'll often be found fishing in small lakes around Missouri.
